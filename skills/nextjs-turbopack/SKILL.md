Traffic One precedence: follow this skill only where it does not conflict with Traffic One AGENTS.md and rules/*.md. Forced stack choices, approved libraries, i18n, styling, services, state, testing, accessibility, security, and backend technology rules from Traffic One take precedence. Treat upstream examples that use unapproved frameworks or libraries as conceptual patterns to adapt.

# Next.js and Turbopack

Next.js 16+ uses Turbopack by default for local development: an incremental bundler written in Rust that significantly speeds up dev startup and hot updates.

## When to Use

- **Turbopack (default dev)**: Use for day-to-day development. Faster cold start and HMR, especially in large apps.
- **Webpack (legacy dev)**: Use only if you hit a Turbopack bug or rely on a webpack-only plugin in dev. Disable with `--webpack` (or `--no-turbopack` depending on your Next.js version; check the docs for your release).
- **Production**: Production build behavior (`next build`) may use Turbopack or webpack depending on Next.js version; check the official Next.js docs for your version.

Use when: developing or debugging Next.js 16+ apps, diagnosing slow dev startup or HMR, or optimizing production bundles.

## How It Works

- **Turbopack**: Incremental bundler for Next.js dev. Uses file-system caching so restarts are much faster (e.g. 5–14x on large projects).
- **Default in dev**: From Next.js 16, `next dev` runs with Turbopack unless disabled.
- **File-system caching**: Restarts reuse previous work; cache is typically under `.next`; no extra config needed for basic use.
- **Bundle Analyzer (Next.js 16.1+)**: Experimental Bundle Analyzer to inspect output and find heavy dependencies; enable via config or experimental flag (see Next.js docs for your version).

## Examples

### Commands

```bash
next dev
next build
next start
```

### Usage

Run `next dev` for local development with Turbopack. Use the Bundle Analyzer (see Next.js docs) to optimize code-splitting and trim large dependencies. Prefer App Router and server components where possible.

## Best Practices

- Stay on a recent Next.js 16.x for stable Turbopack and caching behavior.
- If dev is slow, ensure you're on Turbopack (default) and that the cache isn't being cleared unnecessarily.
- For production bundle size issues, use the official Next.js bundle analysis tooling for your version.
